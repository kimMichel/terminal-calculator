# Simple Terminal Calculator

## About the Project

This is my Day 1 project of 100 days of Code: Python by Angela Yu. With this project I tryed make some different stuff, taking all the concepts I learned on the first section of the course.
Its a really simple calculator that does sum, minus, multiply and divide operation. 

## Concept

I think the most important concept I learned from this section was saving the input from user on the terminal using ```input``` keyword.
